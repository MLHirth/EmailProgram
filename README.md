# EmailProgram
This email program was designed to be able to manage multiple email accounts.
This email program can send and receive emails, using a predefined account. The program is being updated, to instead use an email registration system, allowing users to add more emails than initially specified. 
The program can view the inbox of an email account, allowing users to open the emails directly. A sending system has been implemented, to fulfill email requests. The system is designed to work with all pop3 email systems, allowing email accounts like Gmail, Exchange, and Outlook to work without any problems.
In addition, a calendar has been added to allow users to gain quick and updated access to their calendars. (Google Calendar implementation is still a work in progress, but the calendar can identify some Apple calendar events)
The latest implementation has added a file explorer, allowing users to access files from their system directly.
As the program was a product of a software development project, email accounts and passwords have been removed from the source code.
